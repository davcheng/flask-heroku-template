# Time-webapp

Build a web app that prints out the number of milliseconds since the start of January 1st, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). (50%)

Hint: that start time is also called the “epoch” or “Unix time”.

Build it using Flask.

Deploy to Heroku.

The site must be available at `<NET_ID>-time.herokuapp.com`. In other words, the third-level domain needs to be prefixed with your NetID. (50%)
